# **CSR Computation**

## **Introduction**
If the transverse emittance of the emitting electron bunch is smaller than the diffraction limit at a
given wavelength, then the frequency-domain electric field of the Free-Space Coherent
Synchrotron Radiation (FS CSR) can be easily computed from the Single-Electron SR field, by
multiplying it by a longitudnal form-factor of the electron bunch (which is proportional to the
Fourier transform of longitudinal distribution of the electron density).

We propose a more general method, which takes into account 6D phase space distribution of
electrons in bunches, and covers such cases as "wide and short" (or "rotated" in phase space)
electron bunches, when the transverse emittance of the total electron beam can no longer be
neglected.

## **Examples**
* **Coherent Synchrotron Radiation from Rotated Electron Bunches**

Consider an electron bunch with small (30 micron) longitudinal size (or bunch length) and large
(2 mm) vertical size. Such "rotated" bunches can be created in a storage ring using a transverse
RF-kick technique (this technique was proposed for the generation of femtosecond X-ray pulses
by A.Zholents et. al., 1998). The current example calculates the infrared free-space CSR
generated by such bunches travelling through a bending magnet of a 2.75 GeV storage ring,
and compares this calculation with that of the incoherent SR. The electron density distribution in
the bunches is assumed to be Gaussian with respect to 6 phase-space variables.
